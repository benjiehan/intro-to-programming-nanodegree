        what is ethereum?
        </h2>
            <p>
                Ethereum is a <b>decentralized platform</b> that runs <b>smart contracts</b>: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.<br><br>
                These apps run on a custom built <b>blockchain</b>, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets,<br>
                store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.<br>
                The project was bootstrapped via an ether pre-sale during August 2014 by fans all around the world. It is developed by <a href = 'https://www.ethereum.org/foundation'>the Ethereum Foundation</a>, a Swiss nonprofit, with contributions from great minds across the globe.

        what is a smart contract?
        </h2>
            <p>
                A smart contract is just a phrase used to describe computer code that can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value.<br><br>
                When run on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. Because smart contracts run on the blockchain, they run exactly as programmed<br>
                without any possibility of censorship, downtime, fraud or third party interference. While all blockchains have the ability to process code, most are severely limited. Ethereum is different.<br>
                Rather than giving a set of limited operations, Ethereum allows developers to create whatever operations they want. This means developers can build thousands of different applications that go way beyond anything we have seen before.<br>

        so...how is this different from bitcoin?
        </h2>
            <p>
                Well I'm glad you asked! Oh, you didn't? Awesome! While both Bitcoin and Ethereum are powered by the principle of distributed ledgers and cryptography, the two differ in many technical ways.<br>
                For example, the programming language used by Ethereum is Turning complete whereas Bitcoin is in a stack based language. Other differences include block time (Ethereum transaction is confirmed in seconds compared to minutes for Bitcoin)<br>
                and their basic builds (Ethereum uses ethash while Bitcoin uses secure hash algorithm, SHA-256). (See also: Risks and Rewards of Investing in Bitcoin.)However, from a general point of view, Bitcoin and Ethereum differ in purpose.<br>
                While Bitcoin is created as an alternative to regular money and is thus a medium of payment transaction and store of value, Ethereum is developed as a platform which facilitates peer-to-peer contracts and applications via its own currency vehicle.<br> 
                While Bitcoin and Ether are both digital currencies, the primary purpose of Ether is not to establish itself as a payment alternative (unlike Bitcoin) but to facilitate and monetize<br>
                the working of Ethereum to enable developers to build and run distributed applications (DApps).

        conclusion
        </h2>
            <p>
                In sum, Ethereum is an advancement based on the principle of blockchain that supports Bitcoin but with a purpose that does not compete with Bitcoin. However, the popularity and rising market capitalization<br>
                of Ether brings it in competition with all cryptocurrencies, especially from the trading perspective. Currently, the <a href = 'https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/'>market cap of Ether (ETH)</a> is more than <em>Ripple</em> and <em>Litecoin</em> 
                although itâ€™s far behind Bitcoin (BTC).<br>
                On the whole, Bitcoin and Ethereum are different versions using the blockchain technology, and are set to establish themselves, driven by different intentions.
